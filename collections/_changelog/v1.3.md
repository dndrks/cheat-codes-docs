_global clock_

 - NEW: clocking is handled by the norns global clock, enabling Ableton Link as a clock source
 - CHANGE: all four rec modes are available, regardless of clock source
 - CHANGE: [timing] screen no longer features clk — use PARAMETERS > CLOCK to adjust clocking
 - IMPROVED: tighter clock-synced gestures

_[timing]_

 - NEW: two pages per Pattern! use K2 to access new controls.
 - NEW: rand pat with control over how rates/pitch are distributed (p. 13)
 - NEW: pat start and pat end to adjust Pattern loop points (p. 13)
 - NEW: gridless control over random Patterns • K3 + rand pat selected: random Pattern generated
 - K1 on a P[x] screen: pause playing Pattern [x]
 - K1 + K3 on a P[x] screen: clear current Pattern [x]
 - CHANGE: [timing] screen no longer features clk — use PARAMETERS > CLOCK to adjust clocking
 - IMPROVED: visual indicator next to each P[x] to show whether Pattern [x] is playing, paused, or clear
 - IMPROVED: if Pattern [x] is playing, step number will appear next to each P[x]:

_[loops]_

 - CHANGE: if there’s headway in the buffer, record buffer window movements (E1) now jump the length of the current window. previously, the window would slide incrementally — this makes sense for playback buffers, but clean windows for recording are more helpful.
