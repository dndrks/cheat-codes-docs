the **[timing]** menu is where pads go to hang out with their friends.

as you scroll through a pattern's parameters, you'll see an ellipsis on the left.  

- if it's toward the bottom, this means that there's more to see by turning `E2` CW
- if it's toward the top, this means that you've reached the end of the menu, so turn CCW to scroll back up
